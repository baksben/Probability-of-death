| Criteria | Weighting (%) | Score | Justification | Improvements |
|----------|---------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
|Code runs | 5 | 5 | | |
|Data preparation | 15 | 15 | A few nice exploratory plots produced, good pre-processing of dates to engineer age and night time admission features. Nice use of summaries of death rates to incorporate comorbidity extra data. IterativeImputer used to impute missing data and the data was scaled in the correct manner using the pipeline
|kNN(s) have been used | 10 | 10 | with explicit arguments for number of neighbours, weights and metrics |
|Probability of death for each test patient is computed | 5 | 5 |
|Accuracy | 5 | 4 | > 0.85
|Hyperparameter optimization | 10 | 8 | Reasonable grid searches, would have been good to see investigation of more different values of the number of neighbours, how did you narrow down to 160-200?
|SVM(s) have been used | 10 | 10 | with explicit arguments for cost, kernel and hyperparameters |
|Probability of death for each test patient is computed | 5 | 5 |
|Accuracy | 5 | 4 | > 0.85
|Hyperparameter optimization | 10 | 8 | Good experimentation with kernels, although the grids for the cost and the hyperparameter gamma are not very convincing. Your optimal gamma lies on the edge of the grid which suggests smaller values would have performance better
|Class Imbalance Managed | 5 | 5 | Excellent understanding of Random under sampler and SMOTE show and probabilities reweighted!
|Neat code with titles and comments | 5 | 5 | Really good explanation of methods and thinking behind decision showing good understanding
|Improved methods from those discussed in class | 10 | 3 | Experimentation with SMOTE, consideration of several different kNN metrics

Score: 87
